# EfficientDet: Scalable and Efficient Object Detection

### PyTorch Implementation of the state-of-the-art object detection architecture for EfficientDet 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09070

### Motivation
As of the time I started working on this project, there was no PyTorch implementation on GitHub that would match the original paper in the number of the model's parameters.

### RoadMap
- [X] Model Architecture that would match the original paper
- [ ] COCO train script 
- [ ] Reproduce results from the paper
- [ ] Port weights from TensorFlow
- [ ] Pretrained weights release
