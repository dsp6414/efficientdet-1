### Motivation
As of the time I started working on this project, there was no PyTorch implementation on GitHub that would match the original paper in the number of the model's parameters.

### Model Zoo
| Model Name | Weights | Params | Params paper | mAP | mAP paper |
| :----------: | :--------: | :-----------: | :--------: | :-----: | :-----: |
| D0 | coming soon | 3.875M | 3.9M | soon | 33.8 | 
| D1 | coming soon | 6.618M | 6.6M | soon | 39.6 |
| D2 | coming soon | 8.086M | 8.1M | soon | 43.0 |
| D3 | coming soon | 12.01M | 12.0M | soon | 45.8 |
| D4 | coming soon | 20.694M | 20.7M | soon | 49.4 |
| D5 | coming soon | 33.615M | 33.7M | soon | 50.7 |


### RoadMap
- [X] Model Architecture that would match the original paper
- [ ] COCO train and val script 
- [ ] Reproduce results from the paper
- [ ] Pre-trained weights release
