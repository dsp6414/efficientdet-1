### Motivation
As of the time I started working on this project, there was no PyTorch implementation on GitHub that would match the original paper in the number of the model's parameters.

### RoadMap
- [X] Model Architecture that would match the original paper
- [ ] COCO train and val script 
- [ ] Reproduce results from the paper
- [ ] Pre-trained weights release
